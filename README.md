# Energy-Demand-Forecast
This project focuses on using a SARIMAX model to predict energy demand forecast values using different given data points. We do a lot of statistical analysis on the data and try to find the the best fitting models, do feature engineering to make the model as simpe and accurate(should not overfit) as possible.
